# Retro-Games
What I hope to learn from creating each game:
- Plan, organize, and execute the completion of a project from start to finish
- Improve my knowledge and experience with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the programming languages and how to fix issues within them
- Design a user-friendly interface and simple experience
What I did learn and accomplish developing the 3 games:
- 

## Objectives
For this project, I will be creating 3 popular Games, from the past, with the help of 3 different programming languages and compatible GUI frameworks for other systems.
The games with languages I will be programming in are:
- **Pong** written in Java with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
- **Space Invaders** written in C++ with [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) and including [glew](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- **Pool** written in Swift with SwiftUI (in progress) (SwiftU)

## SetUp Instructions
In there respected folders, each will have corresponding instructions for creating its own game.
[Pong](https://github.com/Edison-Wei/Retro-Games/tree/main/Pong#setup) Setup Instructions
[Space Invaders](https://github.com/Edison-Wei/Retro-Games/tree/main/Space-Invaders#setup) Setup Instructions
[Pool]() Setup Instructions (**Pool will have to be compiled on and only works on Apple devices**)
