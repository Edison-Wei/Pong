# Retro-Games
The outcome of creating each game is to:
- Improve my knowledge and experience with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the programming languages and how to fix issues within them
- Plan, organize, and execute a project from start to finish
- Design a user-friendly experiences

## Objectives
For this project, I will create 3 popular Games, from the past, with the help of 3 different programming languages and their respective GUI framework.
The games and the languages I will be programming with are:
- Pong with Java and JavaFX
- Space Invaders with C++ and glfw with glew
- Pool with Swift and SwiftUI

Each will have corresponding instructions for creating its own game.
 **Pool will have to the compiled and only works on Apple devices**
