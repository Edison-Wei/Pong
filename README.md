# Retro-Games

This project I will be programming 3 popular Retro Games with the help of 3 different programming languages.
The games and the languages I will be programming with are:
	- Pong with Java and Javafx
	- Space Invaders with C++
	- Pool with Swift and SwiftUI

Pong will be programmed in Java, using the JavaFX library as the GUI.
How Pong works is that there are two paddles, one for the player and one for a bot, and a ball that increases in speed everytime it hits a paddles. If the ball passes a paddle a point is awarded.

The Space Invaders game will be programmed in C++, with the help of

With the intention to write clean code, having most functions intended to do one thing
