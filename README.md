# Retro-Games
What I hope to gain from creating each game:
- Plan, organize, and execute the completion of a project from start to finish
- Improve my knowledge and experience with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the programming languages and how to fix issues within them
- Design a user-friendly interface and simple experience

## Objectives
For this project, I will create 3 popular Games, from the past, with the help of 3 different programming languages and compatible GUI frameworks for other systems.
The games with languages I will be programming in are:
- **Pong** with Java and JavaFX
- **Space** Invaders with C++ and glfw with glew
- **Pool** with Swift and SwiftUI (in progress)

## Set-Up Instructions
Each will have corresponding instructions for creating its own game.
